# Audit Summary

## Worktree
- Path: `C:/Users/joesa/Code/harness-loadouts-worktree-flow-clean-output-plan`
- Branch: `feature/worktree-flow-clean-output-plan`
- Base ref used for audit diff: `main` (`git merge-base main HEAD` observed `4df96eabaf4856edb64b2280da748a90ec7195b2` before the audit fix)
- Audit fix commit: `0fb0888bceaa82ff0cc708985850b50846113236`

## Prior implementation summary received
- Implemented quiet-by-default subprocess tracing in `worktree-flow.py`.
- Added `--verbose` to re-enable subprocess command traces in normal runs.
- Preserved dry-run command previews.
- Synchronized `.omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py` and `loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/worktree-flow.py`.
- Recorded skill usage in `.omp/skill-usage.json`.

## Skills loaded
- `audit-worktree`: required by the audit prompt.
- `python-pro`: Python script/dataclass/CLI behavior review.
- `code-reviewer`: spec-compliance and code-quality audit of the changed diff.

## Diff audited
Final `main...HEAD` changed files:
- `.omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py`
- `loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/worktree-flow.py`
- `.omp/skill-usage.json`

## Issues found and fixes applied
1. **Skill ledger used transient worktree paths and stale `main` ledger state.**
   - Found: `.omp/skill-usage.json` pointed `archive_dir`, `skills_dir`, and several `source_path` entries at `C:/Users/joesa/Code/harness-loadouts-worktree-flow-clean-output-plan/...` and would have overwritten newer `main` skill-load entries.
   - Fix: normalized ledger paths back to `C:/Users/joesa/Code/harness-loadouts/.omp/...`, preserved newer `main` entries, and recorded this audit's `audit-worktree`, `python-pro`, and `code-reviewer` skill loads.
   - Commit: `0fb0888bceaa82ff0cc708985850b50846113236`.

No code defects were confirmed in the quiet/verbose/dry-run tracing implementation. The script changes match the approved plan: normal command traces are gated by `self.verbose or self.dry_run`, `--verbose` is parsed into `FlowConfig`, and both script copies remain byte-for-byte synchronized.

## Verification run
- `git worktree list && git branch --show-current && git status --short`: confirmed this is branch `feature/worktree-flow-clean-output-plan`, not `main`; handoff/workflow artifacts are untracked.
- `git fetch --all --prune && git merge-base main HEAD && git diff --stat main...HEAD -- . ":(exclude)scratchpad.md" ":(exclude)docs/scratchpad.md" && git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- . ":(exclude)scratchpad.md" ":(exclude)docs/scratchpad.md"`: established base and changed files.
- `git diff --no-index -- .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/worktree-flow.py`: no output, exit 0; scripts are synchronized.
- `python -m py_compile .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py`: passed.
- `python -m py_compile loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/worktree-flow.py`: passed.
- `python -m json.tool .omp/skill-usage.json`: parsed successfully and showed normalized primary checkout paths.
- `python .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py --help`: passed; output includes `--verbose` and path-derived defaults for the canonical script.
- `python loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/worktree-flow.py --help`: passed; output includes `--verbose` and path-derived defaults for the loadout copy.
- `python .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py --plan C:/path/that/does/not/exist.md --repo .`: exited 1 with `Plan file does not exist: C:\path\that\does\not\exist.md` and no `+ (` command trace.
- `python .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py --verbose --plan C:/path/that/does/not/exist.md --repo .`: exited 1 with a leading `+ (...) git rev-parse --show-toplevel` command trace before the missing-plan error.
- `python .omp/scripts/worktree-flow.py --dry-run --plan .omp/worktree-flow/worktree-flow-clean-output-plan/plan.md --repo . --merge-mode stop`: exited 1 at the expected no-implementation-commit validation and printed command previews throughout.
- `git status --short` after commit: clean tracked state; only `.omp/handoff/` and `.omp/worktree-flow/worktree-flow-clean-output-plan/` remain untracked workflow artifacts.

## Skipped checks
- Full non-dry-run workflow execution was not run because it would create and operate on workflow worktrees. The focused checks cover the changed CLI parsing and command tracing behavior.
- A combined Python eval-based verification attempt timed out in the harness kernel; the same checks were rerun as direct commands and passed as listed above.

## Residual risks / follow-up
- None confirmed. The dry-run scenario still exits non-zero when no implementation commit exists; that is pre-existing validation behavior and was used only to verify command preview output.
