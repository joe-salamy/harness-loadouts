- `.codex/scripts/worktree-flow-omp.py`
- `.codex/skill-usage.json`

- `tests/test_worktrees_loadout_sync.py`

## Behavior Changes
- Collapsed duplicated Codex and OMP worktree-flow implementations into shared `worktree-flow.py`.
- Replaced `worktree-flow-codex.py` and `worktree-flow-omp.py` with compatibility wrappers that pass explicit harness defaults.
- Added `--harness-dir` to the shared parser so direct execution can use or override the active artifact directory.
- Moved harness directory and handoff path behavior into `FlowConfig`, avoiding mutable global harness defaults when using multiple wrappers in one process.
- Added implementation guards requiring a commit after base, an actual diff from base, and a clean worktree outside handoff artifacts.
- Added audit guards that require a clean worktree outside handoff artifacts while allowing a no-op audit with unchanged `HEAD`.
- Added final pre-integration guards for no committed handoff artifacts, no pending non-handoff changes, and a branch diff from base.
- Added drift protection test comparing active `.codex/scripts/` files to the shipped `loadouts/worktrees/.harness/scripts/` copies after line-ending normalization.
- Updated worktrees loadout docs to describe the shared implementation and stricter invariants.

## Tests And Checks
- `python -m unittest tests.test_codex_worktree_flow`
  - Result: passed, 53 tests.
- `python -m unittest tests.test_worktrees_loadout_sync`
  - Result: passed, 1 test.
- `git diff --check -- . ':!scratchpad.md' ':!.codex/handoff/**'`
  - Result: passed.
- `python -m unittest tests.test_codex_worktree_flow tests.test_worktrees_loadout_sync`
  - Result: passed, 54 tests.

## Skipped Checks
- Full repository test suite was not run; the approved plan requested focused worktree-flow verification, and the changed surface is covered by the targeted unittest modules.

## Decisions And Tradeoffs
- Kept wrapper filenames and quick-start commands stable to preserve existing user workflows.
- Kept the loadout sync check focused on flow scripts and `skill-usage-manager.py`, matching the approved plan.
- Did not add `loadouts/worktrees/.opencode/scripts/` updates because that directory does not exist in this worktree.
- Committed `.codex/skill-usage.json` because loading the required `implement-worktree` skill was logged per repo instructions.

## Assumptions
- The `.harness` loadout template is the exported worktrees script copy to keep synchronized in this context.
- Audit no-op behavior is valid when `HEAD` is unchanged and `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` shows only handoff artifacts.

## Known Risks
- The new invariant checks are stricter and may stop flows that previously continued with uncommitted non-handoff work or no-op implementation commits.
- `git diff --quiet base...branch -- .` semantics are used for branch-diff detection; unusual repository pathspec behavior could affect edge cases.
