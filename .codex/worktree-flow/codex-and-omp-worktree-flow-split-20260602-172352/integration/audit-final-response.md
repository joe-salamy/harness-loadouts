Audit complete.

- Worktree: `C:\Users\joesa\Documents\law-school-python\harness-loadouts-codex-and-omp-worktree-flow-split`
- Branch: `feature/codex-and-omp-worktree-flow-split`
- Base diff: `main...HEAD`, merge base `bdb64269ea70d4dd96338c9990927cb920e22183`
- Prior summary: implementation split `worktree-flow.py` into Codex and OMP variants, mirrored loadout scripts, updated docs/tests, and removed the old generic script paths.
- Skills loaded: `audit-worktree`, `python-pro`

Issue found and fixed: the live `save-plan` skill still referenced `worktree-flow.py --plan`. I updated both the canonical and loadout skill text to reference `worktree-flow-codex.py --plan` and `worktree-flow-omp.py --plan`.

Audit files changed and committed:
- `.codex/skill-usage.json`
- `.codex/skills/save-plan/SKILL.md`
- `loadouts/worktrees/.harness/skills/save-plan/SKILL.md`

Commit created: `47a19779591f92591f44199493d081903fb0be4c` (`Fix audit findings`)

Checks run:
- `python -m unittest tests.test_codex_worktree_flow` passed, 40 tests.
- `python -m py_compile ...` for both canonical/loadout workflow scripts passed.
- `worktree-flow-codex.py --help` and `worktree-flow-omp.py --help` passed with correct defaults.
- Canonical/loadout comparisons passed.
- Stale-reference scan passed for live files; only historical plan/archive references remain.

Wrote `.codex/handoff/audit-summary.md`; it remains untracked as requested. Final `git status --short` shows only `?? .codex/handoff/`.
